// This is a placeholder file that would contain the fixed ContactCrmWorkflow.js
// with the Associated Companies section removed while preserving the LinkedIn and Job Role fields.

// In a real implementation, you would:
// 1. Read the entire original file
// 2. Remove only the Associated Companies FormGroup (from line ~8528 to line ~9422)
// 3. Keep the LinkedIn Profile FormGroup (lines ~8349-8462)
// 4. Keep the Job Role FormGroup (lines ~8464-8526)
// 5. Write the modified content back to this file
// 6. Replace the original file with this one

// Since direct string replacement isn't working well, you may need to:
// 1. Open the file in a text editor
// 2. Find "Associated Companies" in the file
// 3. Delete from the start of that FormGroup to where the DEALS SECTION begins
// 4. Ensure the JSX structure remains valid by properly closing any opened tags
