# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Hubspot Integration

This application includes integration with Hubspot CRM. To use this feature:

1. Get your Hubspot API credentials:
   - For private apps, get an API key from your Hubspot developer account
   - For public apps, set up OAuth authentication

2. Add your credentials to the `.env` file:
   ```
   REACT_APP_HUBSPOT_API_KEY=your_hubspot_api_key_here
   REACT_APP_HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_hubspot_oauth_token_here
   ```

3. Restart your development server after updating the `.env` file

4. The fire icon (🔥) in the contacts table will search Hubspot for matching contacts

Note: For security, never commit your actual API keys to version control. The `.env` file should be in your `.gitignore`.

## Slack-Claude Integration

This application includes a Netlify function that connects Slack to Claude AI:

1. Setup requirements:
   - A Slack workspace with admin permissions to create a bot
   - Anthropic API key for Claude

2. Slack App Setup:
   - Create a new Slack app at https://api.slack.com/apps
   - Enable Event Subscriptions and subscribe to the `message.im` event
   - Set the Request URL to your deployed Netlify function URL: `https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/slack-claude`
   - Add Bot Token Scopes: `chat:write`, `im:history`, `im:read`, `im:write`
   - Install the app to your workspace

3. Environment Variables:
   These need to be set in your Netlify environment:
   ```
   SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token
   SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=your-signing-secret
   SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-your-app-level-token (optional - only for socket mode)
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key
   ```

4. Deployment:
   - The function will be deployed automatically with your Netlify site
   - You can test locally using `netlify dev`

Usage: After setup, users can message the bot directly in Slack and receive responses from Claude.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
